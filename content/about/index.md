## About Me
Tracy “Trac” Bannon

/trās/

**_Trac Bannon_** is a real technologist and tech evangelist. My focus is the human side of software architecture.

Currently, I am a  Senior Principal at [The MITRE Corporation's Advanced Software Innovation Center](https://www.mitre.org/) and I truly spend my days solving problems for a safer world.

When I have free time I love to writing technical blog posts, read, biking, gardening, learn, and traveling.

Feel free to connect me at Github and Linkedin, leave your thoughts in my blog or share your ideas by [writing an email](mailto:tracybannon@gmail.com). 

I really am a Passionate Architect!!!  But who amd I?  An accomplished software architect, engineer, and DevSecOps advisor having worked across commercial and government clients.  I spend a ton of time with decoupled architectures and especially cloud native!  Of course, gotta leverage modern softare practices like #DevSecOps and #DataOps is core the the picture. I am just as passionate about mentoring and training as I am about architecting sustainable ecosystems! 

Community building and knowledge sharing it a TOP priority!
