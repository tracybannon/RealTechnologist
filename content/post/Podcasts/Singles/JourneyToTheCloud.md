What does the journey to the cloud like when we are discussing application architecture?

I had the pleasure of chatting with Richard Simon from the Cloud Therapists.  We discussed the reality of mmigrating to cloud and the 4 stages defined in a chart that Richard has developing for a number of years, based on the familiar R's of migration and customer interactions.  

You know the R's right?  Rehost, Replatform, Refactor and Rearchitect...you could add Retire and Redesign...

At the end of the day, the unique context of each application matters plus, we have to include the human factor, costs and development implications, as well as the technologies enterprises will likely encounter and employ, throughout the journey.

Of course, I always have some pragmatism to add. 

The key takeaways from this talk are getting an understanding of the 4 stages, the tech stacks involved, skills required and the sheer perseverance needed to deliver all stages and attain success.

We discuss all of that and much more.
