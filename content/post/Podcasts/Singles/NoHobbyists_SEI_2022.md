## #NoHobbyists - How to Shift Security Everywhere

CyberSecurity has traditionally been regarded as a function of a distinct security group. In reality, security and cyber resilient software is the responsibility of everyone in the organization. There is a well intended call to "shift security left" but no one knows how! Instead, organizations are depending on developers to become cyber-savvy on their own. Attendees will learn about why to *not* shift left, how to build a new security culture, and tips, tricks, and tools for moving away from security hobbyists to having experienced pros.

This session was presented at DevSecOps Days Pittsburgh, held virtually April 27, 2022.
