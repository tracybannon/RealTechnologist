++ SAF (  Security Automation Framework)  is a collaborative effort to streamline security automation including operations!  Check out [Safe.mitre.org](http://Safe.mitre.org) 

For operations:

1- Monitor security posture through validation checks

2- Aggregate normalized security testing content to enable data visualization, drill-down, and root cause analysis

3- Assign remediation actions for identified security risks

There is a full community with government sponsors, FFRDCs, and Commercial partners.  Aaron Lippold is the SME!

 
++ATT&CK Framework - This is for ops, dev, and heck, everyone!  This is a knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques. 

 
There is a wealth of information on the site organized by platform including Windows, macOS, Linux, PRE, Azure AD, Office 365, Google Workspace, SaaS, IaaS, Network, Containers.



You can spend an entire afternoon just reading this site!  [https://attack.mitre.org/ ](https://attack.mitre.org/)

[Getting started with Att&ck](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/getting-started/)

There is even a [video.](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/getting-started/))

 

This is only the tip of the iceberg and we haven’t even hit on Continuous Monitoring, Continuous Feedback and the many many many operational considerations!
