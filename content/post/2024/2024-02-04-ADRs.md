# 𝗙𝗼𝗿 𝗵𝗲𝗮𝘃𝗲𝗻'𝘀 𝘀𝗮𝗸𝗲, 𝗪𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗲 𝗜𝘁 𝗗𝗼𝘄𝗻!!! # 

I shared the idea of decision records with a mid-career techie and he was blown away by the value and simplicity.

Using Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) to jot down choices just make sense. It doesn't need to be a full white paper... just a few lines as an .MD file. WHY? So your decisions are defensible and to give anyone in the future a frame of reference.

We are seeing myriad companies and agencies struggling to modernize even the most recent systems because the rationale is missing...

Why not help yourself and others by making risks and trade-offs clear. It helps with identify and mitigate threats, too.

Relevance is undeniable. ADRs "last a generation".... knowledge persists beyond team changes. Everything as code including *decisions*. They belong in a centrally available repo.

Tons of resources to help.
