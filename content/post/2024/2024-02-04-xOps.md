# xOPS: Transdiciplinary approach to incorporating AI into the Software #
For today, I'm going to define 𝘅𝗢𝗽𝘀 as 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗦𝗲𝗰𝗢𝗽𝘀 + 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮𝗢𝗽𝘀 + 𝗠𝗟𝗢𝗽𝘀.  Why though?  Because the integration of AI capabilities into our software requires more than traditional DevSecOps. 

I've spent decades architecting software solutions for complex challenges, I've learned that pragmatism, integration, and flexibility are paramount.

𝘅𝗢𝗽𝘀 𝗶𝘀𝗻'𝘁 𝗮 𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗱𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝘆; it's a transdisciplinary mindset that integrates the 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 of DevSecOps, DataOps, and MLOps.

Alignment makes sure we are addressing our AI systems to be technically adept *as well as* also ethically grounded, secure, and strategically coherent.

In 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗦𝗲𝗰𝗢𝗽𝘀, prioritize 'security by design' and 'defense in depth' to bake cybersecurity into every layer of the infrastructure. Automated workflows and continuous monitoring underscore the proactive stance against emergent threats, while compliance and risk management remain the compass in navigating the complex regulatory landscape.
𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗦𝗲𝗰𝗢𝗽𝘀:
- Secure by Design/Defense In Depth
- Automated Workflows
- Monitoring 
- Infrastructure as Code
- Compliance and Risk Management
- Culture of Continuous Improvement

𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮𝗢𝗽𝘀 extends the agility of DevOps to data management, emphasizing data quality, integrity, and agile practices. It's a commitment to compliance and governance that doesn't compromise on collaboration. It means we all acknowledge, data as the keystone of informed decision-making.
𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮𝗢𝗽𝘀 
- Applying DevOps to data management 
- Data Quality and Integrity
- Agile Data Management 
- Compliance and Governance
- Collaboration

𝗠𝗟𝗢𝗽𝘀 has a few different definitions.  I’m using it as the effective lifecycle management of AI, from model creation to monitoring and validation. Automating and reproducing workflows enhances collaboration but also drives AI solutions to be robust and responsive to an ever-changing operational environment.

- Effective lifecycle management of AI
- Model Lifecycle Management
- Model Monitoring and Validation
- Automated and Reproducible Workflows
- Collaboration

𝘅𝗢𝗽𝘀 is often used to mean fusion of a few things… and my suggestion is no different.  This is weaving together different sets of principles ranging from AI assurance to software architecture.

The true power of the xOps concepts lies in its ability to foster a culture of collaboration, continuous improvement, automation, and flexibility.
 
Seems like a pretty natural call to action for architects, engineers, and leaders alike to reimagine the software development lifecycle (SDLC) so we can safely leverage the potential of AI in service to humanity.
