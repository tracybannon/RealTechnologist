I'm passionate that we grow the next generation of software architects. Brian Chambers and I have been discussing types of skills needed and came across a blog by Matt Shealy. Software architecture a high-demand role that blends engineering and business leadership.

🚀 𝗛𝗮𝗿𝗱 𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀
- Diagramming complex architectures (e.g., C4 Modeling, UML, SysML)
- Deep knowledge of programming languages (Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Rust, Go, C, COBOL)
- Agile and collaborative software development practices, including DevOps expertise

🚀 𝗦𝗼𝗳𝘁 𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀
- Clear communication of mission and expectations
- Coaching & inspiration to help team members achieve goals
- Problem-solving & conflict resolution for both technical and human issues
- Creative thinking to overcome obstacles
- Negotiation

𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗶𝗳 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘄𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘄 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆?
- Find a mentor for guidance and support
- Expand your technical skills across multiple languages
- Leverage opportunities within your current organization to demonstrate your capabilities

𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗶𝗳 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘄𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘄 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝗴𝗲𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀?
- Fine mentees and lean in consistently
- Identify opportunities for your mentee to shadow and really participate as an architect (nothing beats OTJ with a safety net)

While there are plenty of voices out their saying "architecture is dead" and "hurray for engineers", I believe there is a more practical middle ground. I have a degree in software engineering, I'm hands on, and I am proud to be a software architect.
