#𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗼𝗳𝗳𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀 is a crucial step in designing robust systems. It's all about balancing conflicting requirements & goals. Below is a minified approach.

1️⃣ Identify key qualities: Performance, scalability, security, maintainability, usability, etc.
2️⃣ Prioritize: Rank these qualities based on project & business needs. Remember, there's no one-size-fits-all solution!
3️⃣ Evaluate design options: Explore architectural patterns & styles that address your priorities.
4️⃣ Analyze tradeoffs: Understand the pros & cons of each option, and how it impacts other aspects of your system.

5️⃣ Iterate & refine: As you progress, continuously reassess & adjust your architectural decisions. Stay flexible & adaptable!
6️⃣ Capture the Decision: Make sure to capture the decisions. having the context makes decisions defensible.

There are more rigorous and in depth approaches; the most important aspect is that you do the work and capture the oucomes. Architectural decision records (ADRs) are my personal go-to. Remember 🅲🅾🅽🆃🅴🆇🆃 🅸🆂 🅴🆅🅴🆁🆈🆃🅷🅸🅽🅶 .

There is no single approach.
