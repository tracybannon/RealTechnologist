𝗜'𝗺 𝘁𝗿𝘆𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗲𝘁 𝗮 𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗴 𝘀𝘁𝘂𝗰𝗸 𝗶𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗵𝗲𝗮𝗱! Ok, maybe not a song... actually a set of software architecture concepts and principles that drive architectural design decisions.  The process and decisions are almost *𝗻𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿* binary. There is a logical an repeatable way to rationalize decisions: 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗼𝗳𝗳 𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀.   Here is condensed version (I lean heavily on my SEI training and experience.)


Here is condensed version. I lean heavily on my SEI training and experience.

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟭 - Know the mission and business drivers and goals. Tech fails when it's not directly grounded on delivering mission VALUE.

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟮 - Identify the important software quality attributes (SQAs) and remember there can be many including performance, security, maintainability, scalability, reliability, etc. Understand them in the context of your domain and stakeholder needs. Translation: Know the mission drivers and goals.  (Did I say that before?)

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟯 - Identify tactics (aka techniques) that impact and/or achieve the SQAs They might include using specific algorithms, applying design patterns, or following certain architectural styles. Tactics are the tools in an architect's toolbox 

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟰 - Evaluate trade-offs between different SQAs and tactics. This is the heart of architectural decision making. Improving one SQA may detriment another. For instance, you may need to balance implementing an advanced encryption algorithm to boost security (security attribute) that may slow down system performance (performance attribute). 

As a guiding principle: remember that SQAs are not standalone entities—they interact, overlap, and sometimes conflict.

𝘽𝙐𝙏 𝙒𝙃𝘼𝙏 𝘼𝘽𝙊𝙐𝙏 𝙈𝙊𝘿𝙀𝙇𝙎? Architectures need to be living documents and I prefer models. Models help you to simulate and understand the impact of tradeoff decisions. All too often, I get pushback that (1) It's too hard (2) That's only for systems engineering (3) It will slow us down. 

Remember my mantra: be practical and pragmatic... know your context and mission... your domain will likely determine your model usage.


𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟱 -Prioritize, Make Decisions, and Document them! Often, it can be nearly impossible to maximize all quality attributes simultaneously. When you make a tradeoff decision, annotate it! (Simply use architectural decision records-- ADRs.) 

It's actually really challenging and fun not to mention being an integral part of delivering value with software.  Also remember that software is never done 𝘀𝗼𝗼𝗼𝗼𝗼 architecture is never done either...

New needs, threats, and tech mean continuous architecture.
