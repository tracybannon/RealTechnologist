It's odd and simultaneously cool to go back and reference your own book.  As a software architect and engineer, being part of a compendium like 𝗥𝗲𝗶𝗻𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗖𝘆𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 gave me the opportunity to insert DevSecOps principles and align modern software practices.    Perhaps more importantly, was being able to overlay with the most important aspect:  the humans and how to build trust.

Trust is not something you just ask for or earn.  Rather you need to exude trustworthiness and others examine that and decide for themselves if they can or will extend trust.  Charles Green published a "trust equation" that I have adopted for years and can say it is wonderfully helpful.  


The equation 𝗧 = ( 𝗖 + 𝗥 + 𝗜) / 𝗦



Here are the 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗧𝗿𝘂𝘀𝘁𝘄𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀

-𝗖redibility has to do with words and ideas and how someone expresses and shares.

-𝗥eliability are deeds and actions and while it is action oriented, it does include an emotional element. Does the person understand my unique context?

-𝗜ntimacy has to do with a sense of personal and psychological safety; Do you believe that confidences are kept?

-𝗦elf-orientation deals with how much someone is self-absorbed OR are externally altruistic and empathetic?



Think about those you truly trust and those who truly trust you... apply the equation as a learning exercise.
