Do you know what 𝘀𝗼𝗳𝘁𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗯𝘂𝘁𝗲𝘀 are and more importantly, why they matter? Our online community may benefit from talking about 2 topics: Software quality attributes (SQAs) and architecture trade-off analysis. Since trade-offs depend on attributes let’s dig in here first!.

SQAs are overall characteristics of a software solution /ecosystem. These aspects define how software performs, not what it does. They play a crucial role in shaping the software's behavior and functionality in the context of its interaction with users, other systems, and the environment.

Sometimes they are referred to as 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗿𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗶𝗿𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 BUT this is a bit outdated. Why? It’s misleading. The prefix "non-" implies these aspects are less important or secondary to "functional requirements." In reality, SQAs are essential and can be the deciding factor in whether software meets the needs/expectations of stakeholders.

But I digress (I'm sure our community has thoughts to share!)

SQAs are sometimes called the “ilities” though a ton of them don’t end in ‘ility”.  Here are a few uber common ones.

𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲: How effectively software accomplishes tasks in terms of speed, response time, and throughput. How fast does the system respond to user input? How many tasks can it handle at the same time?

𝗥𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: What's ability to function under specified conditions for a specified period of time. How often does the system experience errors or failures? How long can it run without encountering problems?

𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆: This is the ability to resist unauthorized attempts at usage or behavior, protecting data and maintaining functionality as intended. How well does the software protect sensitive data? How effectively does it ward off cyber threats?

𝗨𝘀𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: This is how user-friendly and intuitive software is for the end user. How easy is it for new users to learn how to use it? How satisfied are users with their experience?

𝗦𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: This is all about the ability to handle increased loads, like more users or data processing. Can the software accommodate growth in user numbers or data volume? Can it scale up or down as necessary?

𝗠𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: How easily can changes be made (bug fixes or new features). How easy is it to fix problems or add new features? How quickly can changes be implemented?

SQAs are critical to architecture; architecture provides a structural platform to achieve these attributes.

They guide the design process by helping architects make informed decisions about (you guessed it) the 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗲-𝗼𝗳𝗳𝘀 between different attributes.

Using SQAs, architects design ecosystems to meet the current needs AND anticipates future changes.
