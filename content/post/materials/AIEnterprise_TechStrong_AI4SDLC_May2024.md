Generative AI has taken the world by storm, including the realm of software engineering. There's a rush to incorporate AI tools, from code generation to test analysis. We'll begin with a high-level overview of AI in the software development life cycle (SDLC), then dive into the sometimes-tricky world of using Generative AI in software engineering. This is groundbreaking technology that has limitations and challenges to navigate.  AI-assistance can enhance your delivery of value with the speed and quality your end-users demand.  The key is to use assurance-based techniques.

To bring AI into your enterprise usually takes integrating AI governance into your enterprise strategy and understanding the implications.  

We'll then pivot from viewing AI as merely a tool today to envisioning a future filled with AI agents as team members. By the end of this session, you'll have a solid understanding of both the benefits and challenges of applying AI to the SDLC. Plus, you'll walk away with practical knowledge to start safely leveraging GAI to build and deliver software. This session is ideal for software architects, engineers, developers, project managers, and technical leaders eager to explore the cutting-edge applications of AI in Software Engineering.
