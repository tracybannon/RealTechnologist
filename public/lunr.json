What a year of change this has been.\"\r\ndescription: \"\"\r\ndate:        2020-09-28\r\nauthor:      \"Tracy Bannon\"\r\ncategories:  [\"Tech Reflections\" ]\r\nimage:       \"img/covidgrocery.webp\"\r\ntags:        [\"Tech Predictions\", \"Sharing\", \"Tech Reflections\"]\r\n\r\n---\r\nTech Reflections \r\nWhen I started receiving congratulations messages on my work anniversary, it struck me just how fast the last 525,600 minutes have passed. So much has changed, and yet much remains the same.\r\n\r\nWhat has changed? After nearly 13 years, I left Deloitte Consulting, LLP  to join the MITRE Corporation; I had honestly never thought that I would leave Deloitte.  While I miss my friends and colleagues @ Uncle D’s, I’ve gained anew with MITRE.  Steve Foote, Paul Vencill, Dr. Bob Cherinka, Rick Cagle, and Pat Benito are some of the smartest, seasoned technologists I’ve ever known. Each has a true passion for solving problems for a safer world. My work and contributions at Deloitte directly shaped who I am and have given me unique insights.  When blended with the imperatives of an FFRDC, I find myself leaning in from a software architecture, engineering, and DevSecOps perspective across defense and civilian federal and state governments. My vantage point may have changed and the tech trends have continued to evolve.\r\n\r\nThere are myriad topics to talk about!  For this musing,  I’ll limit myself to a small sampling of what has changed in the last year like DataOps, Data Virtualization, Low Code/No Code, and Software Bill of Materials (SBoM).  I’ll also give my take on what remains the same:  the need for solid Software Architecture and DevSecOps. \r\n\r\nWhat has changed? DataOps, DataOps, DataOps!  This is NOT DevOps for the database. As we shifted workloads to the cloud, we had originally anticipated cloud native refactoring of apps as the next logical step. What we saw was a realization on the power cloud \r\n\r\nbrings to analytics, AI, and MI! This demand explosion means we need new and different “SDLC” approaches. New environments and controls are needed to enable data scientists and data engineers to experiment and develop algorithms.  New techniques for managing, testing, and operationalizing are needed as well.  Some of the new players in this space, like DataKitchen, are thinking through innovative approaches and what Data pipelines look like?\r\n\r\nData Virtualization is another massively important trend that is here to stay.  Moving all of your data to a single location can be a cyber and security risk given the attack surfaces being generated. I often say that data is the greatest asset of the enterprise and you need to treat it like your finances!  You don’t have all your money in a coffee can in the backyard (at least I hope you don’t), and in the same way, all of your data is not in the same place.  You do, however, know exactly where every penny is located and how it is being capitalized and managed.  Isn’t that what we need with our data?   Data virtualization is also a massively helpful technique and tool for modernization enabling you to surface and use old data in old stores in new ways with the nuanced details hidden away.  When you are ready to deprecate or update the old store, the data consumers have no idea or cares; the change can be essentially un-impactful. \r\n\r\nThe adoption of Low Code and No Code platforms (LCNC). We’ve been chasing this for nearly two decades and now technology has caught up with our ideals!  I am clearly a custom dev junkie and yet I realize our enterprise ecosystems need to use Low Code / No Code tools.  There are some risks with the concept of “citizen developers” — functional folks making apps — but with the help of IT,  safe adoption of LCNC can accelerate delivery, enable offloading of repeatable types of workflows to domain experts who can configure to their needs.  With a little partnering from IT to make sure DevSecOps scaffolding (cyber, quality, release) is in place, LCNC platforms like Appian, Microsoft Power Apps, Mendix, and others are enabling the enterprise.  \r\n\r\nWhat about the ongoing explosion of software factories?!   This is both positive and negative.  If you can go faster and provide jumpstarts, how could this possibly be a bad thing?  Software factories are vogue and can absolutely help minimize unnecessary tool sprawl and give much needed data on the value stream, there is also a risk of black boxing away from the engineers and developers.  Be judicious, transparent, and most of all, make sure you have a cadre of black belts on the inner workings of the SWF and the leading practices for using them.  The need to understand the pedigree of every single component and line of code is another risk I’ve been studying thanks to the Software Bill of Materials work (SBoM) by my MITRE colleague, Bob Martin.   Containers are still the golden hammer and having a container strategy is not just smart, it is an imperative. \r\n\r\nWhat remains the same?  The need for solid software architecture! I have witnessed first hand projects that use the term agile and banter about emergent architecture only to be caught flat footed from a security perspective, scalability perspective, and ability to achieve mission value.  The trendy phrase, “emergent architecture,” was coined for small scale applications that leverage industry frameworks and are able to adopt published reference architectures. In those instances, there is an inherited or prescribed architecture that “emerges” during the development and delivery. It was not intended to apply to complex system of system efforts where the cost and practicality of technical debt and risk need to be calculated and addressed.\r\n\r\nLike the term “requirements,” architecture must not be a forbidden word.  Experienced architects and engineers have a specific responsibility to mentor development teams and provide guidance and direction. By establishing the scaffolding and guidance, delivery teams can thrive providing new business features and supporting technical capabilities. My colleagues Scott Bucholtz and Ken Corless at Deloitte recently published a relevant thought leadership piece called “Architecture awakens” that I highly recommend..\r\n\r\nWhat else remains the same?  The need to apply DevSecOps principles using a risk based approach. Don’t “do DevOps” because it isn’t a single thing!  DevOps/DevSecOps is a set of practices that enable quality, stability,  appropriate speed, and security.  What you do and where you focus,needs to be based on your biggest risk areas. This is  especially true when applying to existing efforts and not greenfield.  Have a quality problem? Double down on automated testing and test data management (TDM).  Have a stability issue? Work through infrastructure as code (IAC) for inherent auditability.   Be intentional! Be pragmatic!  \r\n\r\nA week or so ago, I listened to a leading manufacturer admit to banishing the term agile from their lexicon. Why? It is an overloaded term carrying much too much baggage, opinions, and power struggles. Probably the most inspirational and pragmatic statement made was that they are organized to move fast but not at the expense of quality and getting it right the first time. Constant refactoring may work for an isolated mobile application and as a code quality technique but it fails when applied at scale. The role of the architect is guide these types of decisions.\r\n\r\nSo much to talk about!   So after a year of change, after 525,600 minutes of personal and professional change, I’m emerging to share my observations, my experience, and my thoughts.  What topics interest you?  Let’s connect!

Here is a live demo site using this theme.  \r\n\r\nIt is based on huxblog Jekyll Theme\r\nand Clean Blog Jekyll Theme.\r\n\r\nThese two upstream projects have done awesome jobs to create a blog theme, what I'm doing here is porting it to Hugo, of which I like the simplicity and the much faster compiling speed. Some other features which I think could be useful, such as site search with algolia and proxy for Disqus access in China, have also been built in the CleanWhite theme. Other fancy features of upstream projects are not supported by this Hugo theme, I'd like to make it as simple as possible and only focus on blog purpose, at least for now.\r\nWhile I created this theme, I followed the Hugo theme best practice and tried to make every part of the template as a replaceable partial html, so it could be much easier for you to make your customization based on it.\r\n\r\n Screenshots\r\n\r\nHome\r\n\r\n\r\nPost\r\n\r\n\r\nSearch\r\n\r\n\r\nDisqus\r\n\r\n\r\nWechat Pay & Alipay\r\n\r\n\r\nQuick Start\r\nGo to the directory where you have your Hugo site and run:\r\n\r\n`\r\n$ mkdir themes\r\n$ cd themes\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/zhaohuabing/hugo-theme-cleanwhite.git\r\n`\r\n\r\nIf your site is already a git project, you may want to choose to add the cleanwhite theme as a submodule to avoid messing up your existing git repository.\r\n\r\n`\r\n$ mkdir themes\r\n$ git submodule add https://github.com/zhaohuabing/hugo-theme-cleanwhite.git themes/hugo-theme-cleanwhite\r\n`\r\nRun  Hugo Build-in Server Locally\r\n\r\n`\r\n$ hugo serve -t  hugo-theme-cleanwhite\r\n`\r\nNow enter localhost:1313 in the address bar of your browser.\r\n\r\nIf you start from scratch, there is a working Hugo site configured with the CleanWhite theme in the exampleSite directory.  You can use it as a starting point for your site.\r\n\r\nFor more information read the official setup guide of Hugo \r\n\r\n Configuration\r\nFirst, let's take a look at the config.toml. It will be useful to learn how to customize your site. Feel free to play around with the settings.\r\n\r\nComments\r\nThe optional comments system is powered by Disqus. If you want to enable comments, create an account in Disqus and write down your shortname.\r\n\r\n`toml\r\ndisqusShortname = \"your-disqus-short-name\"\r\n`\r\nYou can disable the comments system by leaving the disqusShortname empty.\r\n\r\n Disqus in China\r\nDisqus is inaccessible in China. To get it to work, we can set up a proxy with disqus-php-api in a host which sets between the client browser and the Disqus server. The idea is that if Disqus can be reached in the guest network, the blog page will show the original Disqus comments UI, otherwise, it will downgrade and use the proxy to access the Disqus, the UI will be a little different, but the visitors can still write their comments on the page.\r\n\r\nThe client side java script has already been integrated to CleanWhite them, but you need to set up a proxy server yourself.\r\n\r\nThe proxy is written in php, which can be found here: https://github.com/zhaohuabing/disqus-php-api/tree/master/api\r\n\r\nYou need to specify  your Disqus account information in the config.php.\r\n`\r\ndefine('PUBLIC_KEY', '');\r\ndefine('SECRET_KEY', '');\r\ndefine('DISQUS_USERNAME', '');\r\ndefine('DISQUS_EMAIL', '');\r\ndefine('DISQUS_PASSWORD', '');\r\ndefine('DISQUS_WEBSITE', '');\r\ndefine('DISQUS_SHORTNAME', '');\r\n`\r\nSet the proxy server address in the site config file of your Hugo project.\r\n`toml\r\ndisqus_proxy = \"http://yourdisqusproxy.com\"\r\n`\r\nSite Search with Algolia\r\nFollow this tutorial to create your index in Algolia. The index is just the storage of the indexing data of your site in the the cloud . The search page of CleanWhite theme will utilize this indexing data to do the search.\r\n\r\nGo to the directory where you have your Hugo site and run the following commands:\r\n`bash\r\n$ npm init\r\n$ npm install atomic-algolia --save\r\n`\r\nNext, open up the newly created package.json, where we’ll add an NPM script to update your index at Algolia. Find \"scripts\", and add the following:\r\n`josn\r\n\"algolia\": \"atomic-algolia\"\r\n`\r\nAlgolia index output format has already been supported by the CleanWhite theme, so you can just build your site, then you’ll find a file called algolia.json in the root, which we can use to update your index in Algolia.\r\nGenerate index file:\r\n`bash\r\n$ hugo\r\n`\r\nCreate a new file in the root of your Hugo project called .env, and add the following contents:\r\n`bash\r\nALGOLIAAPPID={{ YOURAPPID }}\r\nALGOLIAADMINKEY={{ YOURADMINKEY }}\r\nALGOLIAINDEXNAME={{ YOURINDEXNAME }}\r\nALGOLIAINDEXFILE={{ PATH/TO/algolia.json }}\r\n`\r\nNow you can push your index to Algolia by simply running:\r\n`bash\r\n$ npm run algolia\r\n`\r\nAdd the following variables to your hugo site config so the search page can get access to algolia index data in the cloud:\r\n `\r\nalgolia_search = true\r\nalgoliaappId = {{ YOURAPP_ID }}\r\nalgoliaindexName = {{ YOURINDEX_NAME }}\r\nalgoliaapiKey = {{ YOURSEARCHONLYKEY }}\r\n`\r\nOpen search page in your browser: http://localhost:1313/search\r\n\r\n Analytics\r\n\r\nYou can optionally enable Google or Baidu Analytics. Type your tracking code in the \r\n\r\n`toml\r\ngoogleAnalytics = \"UA-XXXXX-X\"\r\nbatrackid  = \"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\"\r\n`\r\nLeave the googleAnalytics  or 'batrackid ' key empty to disable it.\r\n\r\nWechat Pay & Alipay Rewards\r\n\r\nYou can enable Wechat Pay & Alipay to allow readers send you money. So if they like your articles, you may even get rewards from your writing. Now you must be motivated to write more.\r\n\r\nEnable Wechat Pay & Alipay in the site config\r\n`toml\r\nreward = true\r\n`\r\nReplace the QR codes of Wechat Pay & Alipay by overriding the photos in folder /static/img/reward/, otherwise the money will be sent to my accounts!\r\n\r\n\r\n Thank\r\nThanks for the great jobs of huxblog Jekyll Theme and Clean Blog Jekyll Theme which are the the two upstream projects CleanWhite Hugo theme is based on.\r\n\r\nFeedback\r\nIf you find any problems, please feel free to raise an issue or create a pull request to fix it. \r\n\r\nIf it's helpful for you, I would appreciate it if you could star this repository, thanks!\r\n\r\n",
