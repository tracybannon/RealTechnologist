      <description>In this video series, Trac Bannon and Bryan Finster belly up to the bar and have an honest dialog about DevOps, Software Engineering, and delivering value. These two spar, disagree, and even invite few guests when they need new punching bags (just kidding). From being a “SADMF” to Culture to debates on the meaning of Autonomy, the content is relevant and unedited. Trac and Bryan even add an occasional guest to spice up the mix!</description>

      <description>My personal journey has taught me the absolute value in diversity; our many varied paths provide a broad set of experiences transforming the fabric of our creative problem solving from burlap to a rich tapestry.
