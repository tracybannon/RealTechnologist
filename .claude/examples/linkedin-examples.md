## Pattern 1: Short & Focused (~100-150 words)

Quick insight with clear takeaway using emoji numbered lists.

### Example: Architectural Tradeoff Analysis

```
#𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗼𝗳𝗳𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀 is a crucial step in designing robust systems. It's all about balancing conflicting requirements & goals. Below is a minified approach.

1️⃣ Identify key qualities: Performance, scalability, security, maintainability, usability, etc.
2️⃣ Prioritize: Rank these qualities based on project & business needs. Remember, there's no one-size-fits-all solution!
3️⃣ Evaluate design options: Explore architectural patterns & styles that address your priorities.
4️⃣ Analyze tradeoffs: Understand the pros & cons of each option, and how it impacts other aspects of your system.

5️⃣ Iterate & refine: As you progress, continuously reassess & adjust your architectural decisions. Stay flexible & adaptable!
6️⃣ Capture the Decision: Make sure to capture the decisions. having the context makes decisions defensible.

There are more rigorous and in depth approaches; the most important aspect is that you do the work and capture the oucomes. Architectural decision records (ADRs) are my personal go-to. Remember 🅲🅾🅽🆃🅴🆇🆃 🅸🆂 🅴🆅🅴🆁🆈🆃🅷🅸🅽🅶 .

There is no single approach.

## Pattern 2: Medium with Stance (~150-250 words)

Share perspective, credit collaborators, take a position against trends.

### Example: Growing Next Generation of Architects

```
I'm passionate that we grow the next generation of software architects. Brian Chambers and I have been discussing types of skills needed and came across a blog by Matt Shealy. Software architecture a high-demand role that blends engineering and business leadership.

🚀 𝗛𝗮𝗿𝗱 𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀
- Diagramming complex architectures (e.g., C4 Modeling, UML, SysML)
- Deep knowledge of programming languages (Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Rust, Go, C, COBOL)
- Agile and collaborative software development practices, including DevOps expertise

🚀 𝗦𝗼𝗳𝘁 𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀
- Clear communication of mission and expectations
- Coaching & inspiration to help team members achieve goals
- Problem-solving & conflict resolution for both technical and human issues
- Creative thinking to overcome obstacles
- Negotiation

𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗶𝗳 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘄𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘄 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆?
- Find a mentor for guidance and support
- Expand your technical skills across multiple languages
- Leverage opportunities within your current organization to demonstrate your capabilities

𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗶𝗳 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘄𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘄 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝗴𝗲𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀?
- Fine mentees and lean in consistently
- Identify opportunities for your mentee to shadow and really participate as an architect (nothing beats OTJ with a safety net)

While there are plenty of voices out their saying "architecture is dead" and "hurray for engineers", I believe there is a more practical middle ground. I have a degree in software engineering, I'm hands on, and I am proud to be a software architect.

## Pattern 3: Educational/Rally Cry (~300-400 words)

Adapted from blog content, lots of resources, credits multiple people.

### Example: #NoHobbyists

```
hashtag#NoHobbyists when it comes to Cyber Security!  We cannot allow our people and our teams to be completely self-taught in their free time!   We all agree to shift security left, but is that realistic?

Security is a shared sport. We all sense a shortage of "cyber pros" and we are placing tremendous faith in automated pipelines.

In addition to designing/implementing mission logic and the tests to visibly  demonstrate quality, developers are front and center cyber-security. Upskilling and innovative tools are not developer focused!

We must protect and enable developers and the entire stream aligned team! Here are ideas and techniques from my experience and from quite a few peers and luminaries:

++Put structure around developer education - Most security training for developers lacks depth and examples.  Focus on the 70:20:10 model with 70% on the job experience and challenges , 20% informal like mentoring and 10% formal training.

I'm doing this now with stream-aligned teams and avoiding heavy upfront training.  This doesn't mean no formal training; it means focus on applying what has been learned. Gary Gruver's EDT and the new DEVOPS INSTITUTE pathways take this approach!

++Teach developers to think about breaking things -Sounds counterintuitive? Nope!  Developer mental maps are to create new and build.  Include "how to break it" dialog in training, visioning, peer reviews and paired walkthroughs.

I advocate a short tour-of-duty with true operations folks who are frontline in daily debugging.

Give the entire delivery team time to play with the OWASP training projects like WebGoat. https://lnkd.in/dHzVk_aq

++Plan time and funding for Upskilling and Education - Perhaps the biggest challenge to reducing hobbyists is to commit funding and plan time for cornerstone learning.

++Treat Thread Modeling as a Team sport - Build a shared culture by threat modeling together.  Here is a quick cheat sheet from my favs, OWASP: https://lnkd.in/dXcMHyus

++Encourage Experimentation - This is the basis for all modern software engineering!  With experimentation will come outcomes. Whether you label them success or failure, learn fast and iterate, celebrating each new outcome. Bryan Finster and I focus on this daily!

++Embrace Shared Responsibility And Give Grace - Cybersecurity is shared responsibility. Band together to move past our decades of retribution fears. See Lisa Plaggemier's Security Optimism 2022 https://lnkd.in/dphB2T_z

Synopsys has a quick post on security training for devs: https://lnkd.in/db3c47h4

If you take away a single thought, it is that we cannot lob more responsibility onto developers without arming them, and the organization!!  Security is not for self-taught hobbyists.

## Pattern 4: Empathetic/Analogical (~300-350 words)

Extended metaphor sustained throughout, grace-focused.

### Example: Continuous Exhaustion (Swimming Analogy)

```
**Continuous everything is leading to continuous exhaustion.** The root cause will surprise you:  good intentions!    If we want to encourage growth and improvement, we need to start with patience, grace, and understanding of our people, teams, and organizations.

To understand why we are exhausted, let's use the analogy of learning to swim.  Everyone has a different affinity for water and swimming.  Everyone's physical condition and stamina differs.

Some are naturals and jump into the deepest coldest water with seeming little impact.  They bob to the surface and say "come on in!"  Not all fall into that category.

+Value over velocity - Many in our software architecture and engineering field have been pushing back hard at the over-focus on velocity.  "GO FAST" is not the goal.  We need to deliver value at the speed of relevance.

Teach everyone about value: what it is, how to measure, and what is their role in delivering business/mission value.

+Be ready with swimmies, kickboards, and  life-rings.  Some of your team will need just a slight confidence boost that comes with arm-swimmies.  Others will have confidence and will need practice that comes with a kickboard.  Occasionally, toss a life-ring and keep you people afloat. hashtag#HumansFirst

+Pepper in laser-focused teaching moments - When someone is struggling to make that first length of the pool, give them one improvement to get them to the end:
 "Keep breathing on every stroke", "kick from the hips", "remember to pull".

A simple reminder on one aspect can often give the small improvement needed to finish that length.

+Encouragement always - I cannot overstate the importance of sincere encouragement!  This is such a contagious act.  Clap, cheer, laugh, smile.  We are in this together.

+Rest and catching your breath is important - Sometimes, you need to hold onto the side of the pool and catch your breath.  Give yourself and your people that respect.  And once they've caught their breath, encourage them to try again.

+Make the lifeguard visible always - It is important to everyone that they know someone is there to bail them out, to buffer them, to protect them, and sometimes, to call them out when they go astray.

Every organization and every team and every person should know the basic lifesaving skills.  How can we tell if someone is in trouble? What should we do based on our own skill level.   The Red Cross used to teach new lifeguards to triage "reach, through, row, go".

Ultimately, this impacts quality, morale, cyber security, resiliency, and quiet honestly, every dimension and aspect of organization. Addressing this keeps hashtag#HumanDebt and hashtag#techdebt at bay.

I'd love to hear how you are helping your teams, organizations and yourself to be continuous without being exhausted.

## Pattern 5: Reflective/Philosophical (~250 words)

Starts with concept/quote, tells story, applies personally.

### Example: Burn the Ships

```
"Burn the ships at the beach."  I can't seem to shake this phrase.  It has such deep and universal meaning.  Why burn the ships at the beach?  It means do something that forces you to continue forward and makes it impossible to return to where you were.

It is loosely attributed to Hernán Cortés when he landed in Mexico.  Knowing his crew was exhausted  after the journey so far, he had to find a way to motivate them to find ways to succeed in that new land.  He ordered his ships be scuttled.  YIKES!

I am repeating this to myself multiple times each day lately and helping my teams with this as well.

++Can you create a weekly status report?  No, my updates are on Confluence. hashtag#BurnTheShips

++Let's stand up a centralized architecture governance board?  No, let's meet and help programs and product teams where they are. hashtag#BurnTheShips

++Do we really need a 10 minute standup every day?  Yes, it is a huddle to make us effective each day. hashtag#BurnTheShips

The idea is NOT to ignore history or context.  The idea is to force new muscle strength and retrain old muscle memory.  I've been diving into thought leadership from Patty Azzarello and invite y'all to read her book "MOVE".   Thanks to Christina Rhylander for the recommendation!

Patty discusses that transformations and change start with ideas and energy and lose momentum in the long long middle.  That is when we need to hashtag#BurnTheShips so to speak.

Modern software practices require wholescale change.   Make your first step designing a path to production. hashtag#BurnTheShips that production is something to worry about later on in the development phase.  Implement CD; #BurnTheShips that automation is expensive and hard.

What other ways can you think of to apply this philosophy of  taking steps to prohibit backsliding?

Something to noodle on...
