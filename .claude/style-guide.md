1/ #NoHobbyists when it comes to Cyber Security!

We cannot allow our teams to be completely self-taught in their free time.

Here's what organizations need to do instead 🧵

2/ First: Agree that software security is a shared sport.

There is no one in the organization exempt or excluded.

3/ Second: Recognize the talent shortage.

Global shortage is 3.4 million workers. We need to upskill our current teams.

[Continue through point...]

## Technical Writing Guidelines

### Explaining Concepts
1. **Start with the "why"**: Context before detail
2. **Use analogies**: Relate new concepts to familiar ones
3. **Build progressively**: Simple to complex
4. **Show real examples**: Abstract plus concrete
5. **Acknowledge complexity**: Don't oversimplify, but make accessible

### Acronyms & Jargon
- **First use**: Spell out with acronym in parentheses
- **Explain when needed**: Don't assume everyone knows
- **Challenge jargon**: Ask "is there a clearer way to say this?"
- **Context clues**: Help readers infer meaning
- **Link to resources**: When deep dives are available

### Citations & Credits
- Link to sources generously
- Credit people by full name and link to their LinkedIn
- "Thanks to [Name]" for ideas that influenced you
- Credit image sources always
- Use hyperlinks rather than ugly URLs in text

### Data & Statistics
- Cite sources for claims
- Provide context for numbers
- Use comparisons to make data meaningful
- Don't overwhelm with too many stats
- Lead with the insight, not the number

## Values Reflected in Writing

### Inclusivity
- Avoid gendered language (use "they/them" for singular)
- Don't assume knowledge level
- Welcome questions and different perspectives
- Celebrate diverse backgrounds and paths into tech
- Call out when you're simplifying for accessibility

### Growth Mindset
- Frame failures as learning opportunities
- Celebrate experimentation
- Acknowledge what you don't know
- Share your own learning journey
- Encourage trying new approaches

### Practical Over Perfect
- Done is better than perfect
- Start small, iterate
- Share works-in-progress
- Acknowledge constraints
- Real-world application beats theoretical purity

### Empathy & Grace
- Recognize people are doing their best
- Acknowledge systemic challenges
- Don't blame individuals for structural problems
- Extend psychological safety through words
- Remember the human on the other side
