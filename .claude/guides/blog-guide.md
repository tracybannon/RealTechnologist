# Blog Writing Guide

Your blog is where you dive deep into topics, tell comprehensive stories, and provide thorough guidance. Blog posts are longer-form content (800-1500 words) that educate and provoke thought.

## Blog Post Structure

### 1. Engaging Hook
Start with something that grabs attention:
- **Question to reader**: "Is Platform Engineering the new DevOps?"
- **Personal address**: "Hello friends, it's been a long time..."
- **Bold statement**: "For heaven's sake, Write It Down!!!"
- **Context setting**: "When it comes to cybersecurity, we have a talent and knowledge deficit..."

**Purpose**: Pull readers in, make them want to keep reading

### 2. Context Setting
Why this matters now:
- What's happening in the industry
- Personal experience that led to writing
- Problem you're seeing repeatedly
- Gap you're addressing

**Length**: 1-3 paragraphs
**Tone**: Conversational, sets stage for what's coming

### 3. Core Content
Break into clear sections with unicode bold headers:

```markdown
## 𝟭 - [First Major Point]
[Explanation with examples]

## 𝟮 - [Second Major Point]
[Explanation with examples]

[Explanation with examples]
```

**Each section should**:
- Have clear unicode numbered header (𝟭, 𝟮, 𝟯...)

- Include real-world examples
- Be digestible (3-5 paragraphs)
- Build on previous sections

**Use**:
- Numbered lists for steps/phases

### 4. Actionable Takeaways
What readers should do:
- Specific actions they can take

### 5. Call to Engagement
End with invitation:
- "Something to noodle on"
- "You game?"
- Question that calls back to opening
- Forward-looking statement
- "If you take away a single thought..."

### 6. Hashtags
**Count**: 5-7 relevant hashtags
**Format**: `#SomethingToNoodleOn #SoftwareArchitecture #DevSecOps`
**Always include**: #SomethingToNoodleOn when appropriate

### 7. Image Attribution
**Always credit**:

## Opening Patterns

### Personal Story
```
Hello friends, it's been a long time…'23 was quite a rollercoaster for
me personally and professionally. I am so thankful for the support of
my network, my family, and my friends. I am ready for '24!
```

Is "Platform Engineering the new DevOps"? Not exactly, no. It is another
evolutionary technique to drive quality, security, and time to delivery...
```
**When**: Myth-busting, clarifying misconceptions

### Problem Statement
```
When it comes to cybersecurity, we have a talent and knowledge deficit
right now. The truth is that organizations have not budgeted or planned
for the consistent upskilling need.

### Bold Declaration
```
For heaven's sake, Write It Down!!! I shared the idea of decision records
with a mid-career techie and he was blown away by the value and simplicity.

days. 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗴𝗮𝗺𝗲?

### Forward-Looking
```
The future is not just about what technology can do but how we choose
to use it.
