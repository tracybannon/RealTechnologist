# LinkedIn Writing Guide

LinkedIn is where you educate, advocate, and build community. Your posts range from focused tips to mini-articles adapted from blog content.

**See real examples**: [LinkedIn Examples](../examples/linkedin-examples.md)

## Five Core Patterns

You use five distinct post patterns, each serving a different purpose:

### 1. Short & Focused (100-150 words)
**When to use**: Quick insight, single concept, clear takeaway
**Goal**: Educate quickly, reinforce key principles

**Structure**:
1. Bold unicode hashtag/concept opening (#𝗧𝗼𝗽𝗶𝗰𝗡𝗮𝗺𝗲)
2. One sentence context
3. Emoji numbered list (1️⃣ 2️⃣ 3️⃣ 4️⃣ 5️⃣ 6️⃣)
4. Brief explanation for each point
5. Personal aside in one point
6. Special unicode callout for signature theme
7. Final short declarative statement
8. 4-5 hashtags

**Template**:
```
#𝗧𝗼𝗽𝗶𝗰𝗡𝗮𝗺𝗲 is [why it matters]. [Brief context sentence].

1️⃣ [First point]: [Brief explanation]
2️⃣ [Second point]: [Brief explanation]
3️⃣ [Third point]: [Brief explanation]
4️⃣ [Fourth point]: [Brief explanation]
5️⃣ [Fifth point]: [Personal aside - "X is my personal go-to"]
6️⃣ [Sixth point]: [Brief explanation]

Remember 🅲🅾🅽🆃🅴🆇🆃 🅸🆂 🅴🆅🅴🆁🆈🆃🅷🅸🅽🅶.

[Short declarative statement reinforcing theme].

#Tag #Tag #Tag #Tag
```

**Key elements**:
- Use & instead of "and"
- One personal touch ("my personal go-to", "my favs")
- Signature theme in special unicode
- No question at end - take a stance

---

### 2. Medium with Stance (150-250 words)
**When to use**: Share perspective, counter trends, advocate for approach
**Goal**: Take a position, credit collaborators, inspire action

**Structure**:
1. Personal opening ("I'm passionate that...")
2. Credit collaborators by name
3. Context paragraph
4. 🚀 Emoji headers for sections
5. Bulleted lists under each section
6. Parallel unicode bold sections (e.g., personal vs team growth)
7. Counter-trend statement
8. Personal declaration of stance
9. 4-6 hashtags including #HumansFirst

**Template**:
```
I'm passionate that [belief/position]. [Collaborator Name] and I have
been discussing [topic]...

🚀 𝗙𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝗖𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗼𝗿𝘆
- Point one
- Point two
- Point three

🚀 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗖𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗼𝗿𝘆
- Point one
- Point two
- Point three

𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗶𝗳 [scenario A]?
- Advice one
- Advice two (practical detail in parentheses)

𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗶𝗳 [scenario B]?
- Advice one
- Advice two

While there are plenty of voices saying [X], I believe [Y counter-position].
I [personal credentials/declaration].

#Tag #Tag #HumansFirst
```

**Key elements**:
- Name people (full names, no @ tags)
- Shorthand: "next gen", "OTJ"
- Parenthetical details
- Clear counter-position to trends
- Personal declaration of stance

---

### 3. Educational/Rally Cry (300-400 words)
**When to use**: Adapted blog content, comprehensive guidance, call to action
**Goal**: Educate thoroughly, provide resources, rally community

**Structure**:
1. Rally cry opening ("hashtag#NoHobbyists...")
2. Rhetorical questions setting up problem
3. Short context paragraphs (2-3 sentences each)
4. Transition: "Here are ideas/techniques from my experience and peers:"
5. List with ++ markers
6. Each ++ has unicode bold header + explanation
7. Personal experience woven throughout
8. Counter-intuitive framing when appropriate
9. Credit multiple people
10. Link to resources inline
11. Signature closing: "If you take away a single thought..."
12. 5-7 hashtags including specialty tags

**Template**:
```
hashtag#RallyCry when it comes to [topic]! We cannot allow [problem]!
[Rhetorical question challenging status quo]?

[Context paragraph 1: State the challenge]

[Context paragraph 2: Current state and gaps]

Here are ideas and techniques from my experience and from quite a few
peers and luminaries:

++[Bold Header] - [Explanation of approach]. [Personal experience:
"I'm doing this now..." or "I advocate..."]

[Additional context]. [Name]'s [work/framework] takes this approach!

++[Bold Header] - Sounds counterintuitive? Nope! [Explanation].

[Personal practice]. [Resource/tool mention with link]

++[Bold Header] - [Explanation]. [Collaborator Name] and I focus on
this daily!

++[Bold Header] - [Explanation]. See [Name]'s [work] [link]

[Additional resource]: [link]

If you take away a single thought, it is that [key takeaway]!!

#Tag #Tag #HumansFirst #SpecialtyTag
```

**Key elements**:
- "hashtag#Tag" written out in opening
- ++ not bullets or numbers
- "Sounds counterintuitive? Nope!"
- Multiple people credited

### 4. Empathetic/Analogical (300-350 words)

**Goal**: Build empathy, provide nuanced perspective, offer compassion

**Structure**:
1. Bold opening statement with surprise element
2. Set up analogy/metaphor
3. Develop analogy with relatable details
4. + markers for list
5. Each + ties concept to analogy
6. "hashtag#Tag" inline for emphasis
7. Personal emphasis ("I cannot overstate...")
8. Inclusive language throughout
9. Question inviting sharing
10. 8-13 hashtags (broader topic = more tags)

**Template**:
```
**[Problem statement].** The root cause will surprise you: [unexpected cause]!
If we want [outcome], we need to start with [approach].

To understand [problem], let's use the analogy of [relatable situation].
[Develop analogy with universal details].

[Extend analogy showing range of experiences].

+[Principle] - [Explanation tied to analogy].

[Practical application of principle].

+[Principle] - [Analogy-specific details: "swimmies, kickboards, life-rings"].

[How it applies to work context].

+[Principle] - I cannot overstate [importance]! [Why this matters].
We are in this together.

+[Principle] - [Give grace explanation]. Give yourself and your people
that respect.

[Synthesis paragraph tying back to work impact]. This keeps
hashtag#HumanDebt and hashtag#techdebt at bay.

I'd love to hear how you are [question related to topic].

#Tag #Tag #Tag #Tag #Tag #HumansFirst #CommunityofCommunities
```

**Key elements**:
- Bold opening with **asterisks**

### When to Ask Questions
- **Empathetic posts**: "I'd love to hear how..."
- **Reflective posts**: "What other ways can you think of..."

- **Why**: Establishes thought leadership
